Trail Mapping
============
This layout is intended to survey information to support tagging paths (a.k.a Trails in the US), specifically for hiking, but also for mountain biking and horseback riding.

This layout draws from the original 

Button sets or pages  
--------------------

The button sets should assist you with surveying such features as a 'track' which is used by farm vehicles, but is also a Public Right of Way (UK probably), designated as a **footpath**.  
**Button sets include**;  



*  **LOOKS LIKE** - allows you to chose what the feature looks like, such as a track or a path.  
*  **DESIGNATION** - if signed, allows you to note the designation displayed.  
*  **ACCESS** - Who is allowed such as foot=yes, bike=no.  
*  **SURFACE** - Asphalt, gravel, grass, etc..  
*  **BARRIER** - Bollards, gates, kissing-gates, stiles (with buttons for steps up to or down from), etc..   
*  **VARIOUS** - Is it lit? Are dogs allowed, are there dog-poo bins? Bench & information boards.  
*  **WIDTH** - 9 buttons of different options.    
*  **SOLAR -ERRORS** - Roof PV panels and orientation, and 'Errors' for those moments when you took the wrong fork and want to have a note of this.  
*  **TRACKTYPE** - Buttons for each of the grades. 
*  **SMOOTHNESS** - Buttons for each grade, with an indication as to you should tag it as.


Photo or Voice of Text Fields (Name, Operator)
Three buttons on a row gives about 8 or 9 letters, four buttons give 6 or 7
Keep Photo and Voice on each sub page.  Too bad there is not a "back" button on screen.
